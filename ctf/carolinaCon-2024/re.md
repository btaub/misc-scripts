## flag

A few letters were annoyingly omitted in the debugger. After some thinking and trial/error with single-stepping through the binary (and a slight but fair hint from challenge author), the final flag was: 
`cc_ctf{1_h0p3_y0u_scr1pt3d_th15_1nst34d_0f_m4nu4lly_TRYING_t0_retype_this_entire_fl4g_b3c4use_th4t_w0uld_have_t4k3n_a_v3ry_l0ng_tim3!}`
